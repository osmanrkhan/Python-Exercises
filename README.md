# Python-Exercises
Here are some Python exercises that were a bit more challenging. I've put exactly what each one does at the top of the program
Here's a little contents page for the current exercises

ex1 Prints the numbers 1 to 50. 

ex2 Prints the numbers 1 to 50 (but this time, only multiples of 10 or 3).

ex3 Prints all Fibonacci numbers up to a number.

ex4 Calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000

ex5 Function called "all_less_than_5", accepts a list of numbers as a parameter. Print all numbers that are less than 5. 

ex6 Prints the current Date & Time.

ex7 Asks the user for a radius. Once the user enters the radius, prints the Area of the corresponding circle. 

ex8 Function called "find_min" that accepts a list of numbers as a parameter. This function returns the minimum value in the list. WITHOUT USING THE BUILT-IN PYTHON "min()" FUNCTION!!!

ex9 CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

ex10 Asks a user for a day, then a month, then a year (three separate inputs). If the data is valid, it prints the number of days since my birthday

ex11 Reads the file "sample2.txt" (in this folder), and prints all the contents of the file WITH LINE NUMBERS.

ex12 Takes a string (some sentence in English with correct grammar), and returns a list of words. There should be no punctuation in the list (except for apostrophes). 

ex13 Takes a string THAT CONTAINS SOME NEWLINES (some sentence in English with correct grammar), and returns a list of words. There should be no punctuation in the list (except for apostrophes).
